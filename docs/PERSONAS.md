# Worldviews - Persona Definitions

## Persona Design Principles

1. **Exaggerated but Recognizable** - Each persona is a caricature of real ideological positions
2. **Internally Consistent** - Personas react predictably based on their worldview
3. **Non-Offensive** - Satirical without targeting protected groups or individuals
4. **Diverse Spectrum** - Cover multiple axes of political/ideological thought
5. **Humorous** - Self-aware and entertaining, not preachy
